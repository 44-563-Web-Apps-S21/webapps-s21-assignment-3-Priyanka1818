        <p>The Shettles method differs from the Ericsson method, in which the semen is deposited outside 
           the woman and time is given for the fast/slow swimmers to separate before artificial insemination 
           takes place. </p>

<h1>CODE DISPLAY</h1>
<p>FP is a programming language created by John Backus to support the function-level programming[2]
    paradigm. This allows eliminating named variables. The language was introduced in Backus's 1977 
    Turing Award paper, "Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?", subtitled
     "a functional style and its algebra of programs." The paper sparked interest in functional 
     programming research,[3] eventually leading to modern functional languages, and not the 
     function-level paradigm Backus had hoped.</p>
